I’m a **Principal ML Engineer** at **Level AI**, where I focus on building and scaling large language models (LLMs) specifically for conversational AI. With over four years of experience in applied AI and research, I’ve worked extensively on end-to-end solutions in NLP and ML systems.

Before Level AI, I worked as a **Data Scientist** at **Mastercard AI Garage**, where I developed AI models to enhance transaction security and intelligence. I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science from the **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**.

My technical interests include Natural Language Processing, ML Systems Engineering—including CUDA and Triton for high-performance computing, Privacy-preserving ML, and Cryptography. 

I’m always working on side projects, many of which involve implementing and experimenting with ideas from research papers, efficient kernels and other low-level stuff in LLM training/inference regime. You can find these projects here.
