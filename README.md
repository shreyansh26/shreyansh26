I am working as a **Lead ML Engineer** at **Level AI**. I have close to 3 years of full time experience working on applied AI and research. I have previously worked as a **Data Scientist** at **Mastercard AI Garage** as well, where we were leveraging AI to make the transactions world a smarter and secure place. I am a graduate of the class of 2020 in Computer Science from **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**. I'm passionate about Natural Language Processing, Privacy-presrving ML, Model Compression and Cryptography. I love to take on interesting major and minor side projects, all of which you can check out here.
