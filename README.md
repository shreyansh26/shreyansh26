I’m the **Principal ML Engineer** at **Level AI**, where I focus on building and scaling large language models (LLMs) specifically for conversational AI. With over four years of experience in applied AI and research, I’ve worked extensively on end-to-end solutions in NLP and ML systems.

Before Level AI, I worked as a **Data Scientist** at **Mastercard AI Garage**, where I developed AI models to enhance transaction security and intelligence. I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science from the **Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi**.

My technical interests include Natural Language Processing, ML Systems Engineering—including CUDA and Triton for high-performance computing, Privacy-preserving ML, and Cryptography. 

I’m always working on side projects, many of which involve implementing and experimenting with ideas from research papers, efficient kernelsand other advanced techniques in these areas. You can find these projects here.
